# Cursors

Cursors are what allows `fn()` to navigate around the atoms it needs to process. The default cursor is designed to handle stopping the process early and controlling inputs and outputs.

The default cursor has been abstracted out with the thinking that it could be replaced by other cursors. But as it stands the default does everything needed so far.
